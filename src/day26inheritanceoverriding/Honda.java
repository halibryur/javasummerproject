/*
 	1)When you override a method, you can use same 
 	  access modifiers
 	2)When you override a method,
 	  Access modifier in child class cannot have 
 	  narrower access modifier
 	3)private methods cannot be overridden, because overriding means
 	  you want to use the method in another class but private class members
 	  cannot be used in other classes
 	  
 	  final methods cannot be overridden, because final method's body 
 	  cannot be updated but in overriding, we update the method body.
 	  
 	  static methods cannot be overridden, because static methods are 
 	  common methods for all child classes. If any child updates it, 
 	  the other classes will be affected, it can create problems
 	  because of that Java does not let overriding for static methods. 
 	    
 	4)@Override annotation checks the overriding rules, if there is any
 	  missed or used wrongly overriding rule, it will give CTE.	 	  
 	5)In overriding, return types of "overridden" and "overriding" methods 
 	  can be same
 	6)In overriding, form "overriding" method return type to 
 	  "overridden" method return type you must have "IS-A" relationship.
 	  Note: If there is "IS-A" relationship between return types, 
 	  return types are called "Covariant Return Types"
 	7)In overriding, if the return type is "primitive"
 	  return types of "overridden" and "overriding" methods must be same
 	8)In overriding, if the return type is "void"
 	  return types of "overridden" and "overriding" methods must be "void"
